# LAB 1: Artemis and Bluetooth
The goal of this lab was to familiarize us with the microcontroller (Artemis Nano) that we would be using for the rest of the semester. In this lab, I tested out the basic functionality of the microcontroller and established a Bluetooth connection between the Artemis Nano and my computer. This lab has two parts, which are described below.

# Part A:
Prelab: I downloaded the Arduino IDE and installed the necessary libraries to program the Artemis Nano using the Arduino IDE. 

Task 1: Blink

In this task, I loaded a default example program into the Artemis Nano that blinked its LED. This tested the basic functionality of the board. 

Task 2: Serial

Task 3: Temperature Sensor

Task 4: Microphone Output
