# LAB 1: Artemis and Bluetooth
The goal of this lab was to familiarize us with the microcontroller (Artemis Nano) that we would be using for the rest of the semester. In this lab, I tested out the basic functionality of the microcontroller and established a Bluetooth connection between the Artemis Nano and my computer. This lab has two parts, which are described below.

# Part A:
Prelab: I downloaded the Arduino IDE and installed the necessary libraries to program the Artemis Nano using the Arduino IDE. 

Task 1: Blink

In this task, I loaded a default example program into the Artemis Nano that blinked its LED. This tested the basic functionality of the board. 

Task 2: Serial

I tested the serial communication between the Artemis and the computer. I had to lower the baud rate to 9600 from 115200 to prevent my computer from crashing.

Task 3: Temperature Sensor

I tested the onboard temperature sensor on this board. You can see how the temperature data changes when I blow on it, confirming that it works. 

Task 4: Microphone Output

I tested the onboard Microphone to confirm its functionality and gain more experience with the programming language. In this video, you can see how the frequency count spikes whenever the snap occurs.
